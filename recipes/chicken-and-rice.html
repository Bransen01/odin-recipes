        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Chicken so full of flavour, yet so simple, that these need NO marinading. Who has time to marinade anyway? Especially when you come home in a manic rush and starving to the point of raiding anything that looks good in the pantry.</p>
        <h3><strong><em>Ingredients</em></strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 chicken thighs (bone in and skin on)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/3 cup rice wine vinegar</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons honey</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons pure sesame oil</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic , crushed</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon crushed ginger (fresh)</li>
            <li>2 bunches of baby bok choy (quartered horizontally)</li>
            <li>sliced green onions/shallots</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong><em>Instructions</em></strong></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 220°C | 425°F</li>
            <li>Wash chicken thighs and pat dry with a paper towel.</li>
            <li>Whisk the vinegar, soy sauce, honey, brown sugar, sesame oil, garlic and ginger together in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a rolling boil; reduce heat to low and allow to simmer for about 5 minutes while stirring occasionally until sauce thickens.
                 Take off heat and allow to cool slightly. Place chicken thighs into an oven proof pan/skillet or baking dish. Pour 2/3 of the sauce mixture over the chicken, rotating each thigh until evenly covered. Rotate the chicken to be skin side down, and bake for 30 minutes. Turn thighs and continue to bake until beginning to brown on the skin (about another 15 minutes).
                  At this point, start steaming your bok choy (or any other vegetable), to your desired texture (crunchy, soft, etc).</li>
            <li>Change oven settings to grill/broil on medium heat and grill until the skin changes to deep golden in colour (about 5 minutes).</li>
            <li>Allow chicken to rest for 10 minutes. Serve with the steamed bok choy, shallots/green onion slices and remaining sauce. </li>
        </ol>
